## Lecture 5

## Static functions and members
- Why do we need static members and functions?
- Shared by all but specific to none
- for example: minimum age of a student (not specific to any specific student)
- calling a static function

## Data type limits
- Errors when storing data: isnan (number is not defined, for example = sqrt(-1)
- Errors when storing data: isinf (number is too large, >1e309)

## Inheritance: Pure virtual functions
- What is an interface object?
- How do I make a class "pure virtual"?
- Why would I want to do this?
- How to create interface objects? 

## Libraries (static)
- Revisiting header and source files
- How do I create a simple library?
- How do I connect my executable to a static library?
- What is static linking?

## Functors
- What is a functor?
- How can I create it?
- What is it used for?

## STL Library: Part III
- What happens when I erase items from my containers?
- How expensive is it to add and erase items? (use the profiler)
- Introduction to some useful STL algorithms
- find, copy, sort
