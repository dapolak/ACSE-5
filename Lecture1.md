## Lecture 1

During this class we will be discussing the structure of the course and we will learn the basics of the C++ programming language. We will go over the C++ data types and we will learn how to create a simple C++ programme. We will be roughly following Chapters 1, 2 and 3 of [Stroustrup's Programming -- Principles and Practice Using C++]( http://www.stroustrup.com/programming.html). This lecture will be taught by [Adriana Paluszny](www.imperial.ac.uk/people/apaluszn). The sequence of the lecture will be as follows:
 
###  Introduction to C++: The big picture
- Who created it and when/why?
- Who uses C++?
- Why is C++ so powerful? 
- Why learn C++?
- An online C++ shell: cpp.sh

### Data types in C++
- Memory and data types
- Native types: int, double, char
- Pointers: with great power comes great responsibility
- User-generated types: Objects

## Basic control mechanisms
- if/else
- switch ('if' statement with many options)
- while loops
- for loops

### Compiling and Linking 1: Creating an executable
- Makefiles versus projects.
- Definition of compiling and linking.
- What compilers and linkers should we use and why?
- What happens when we compile?
- Executables. 

### Coding environment
- Editing code.
- What is an integrated development environment? Example: MSVC IDE
- Why use it?

### Basic input and output to console
- Getting started
- The IO Library - http://www.martinbroadhurst.com/stl/standard_library.html
